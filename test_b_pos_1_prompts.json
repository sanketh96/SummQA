examine you now gloria i'm gon na go ahead and do an exam and let's pretend i did my exam i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings just so i can record this and put it into my my into my chart so neck exam you do have a little bit of swelling in your neck little bit of jvd no bruits your lung exam you have some crackles in both bases and some rales that i can hear and there are a little bit of intermittent wheezing as well on your heart exam you have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you've had that in the past otherwise regular rate and rhythm it does n't feel a regular your belly exam your belly's slightly distended there's no tenderness or guarding or anything like that so that does n't that looks pretty good on your leg exam you do have some one plus pitting edema or actually almost one and a half plus pitting edema in your both of your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign that means no blood clots otherwise neurologic exam is normal the rest of your exam is normal so what does this all mean so let me explain that so for the first problem the shortness of breath you know i think you have an exacerbation of your congestive heart failure what i'd like to do is increase your dose of lasix from twenty milligrams to sixty milligrams for the next four days i'm gon na have you check your weights everyday and also i'm gon na go ahead and have you use your albuterol and atrovent we had given you some inhalers in the past i can give you another refill if you need to help with that some of the breathing that you're having the shortness of breath so i'd like to get some of this fluid off you have you check your weights daily we'll have you increase your dose of lasix we'll have you use a breathing treatments and see if that helps your shortness of breath i'd like to have you come back in about couple days actually i wan na see how you're doing and if it does n't get better we may have to increase the dose or send you to the hospital okay\n[patient] i do n't want to go to the hospital doctor\n[doctor] yeah so let's try to let's try to use the lasix and let's try to let's try to you know use the breathing treatments and and do that for the second problem the diabetes that we just talked about i like to go ahead and order another blood test another hemoglobin a1c i think we need to your blood sugars have been running a little bit high in the past and we've had a hard time but it's been a while since we checked your last one so i wan na check another one today to see where we are and when we have you come back in a couple days we should have the results back we can then adjust your metformin or we may have to adjust some of the you know add a different medication at that point but but right now i'm gon na order some blood tests we'll have you come back in a couple of days and then we can reassess at that point okay\n[patient] so i had a piece of cake before i came in here is that gon na affect the the lab work\n[doctor] yeah we'll probably do a fasting blood sugar we'll we'll order the hemoglobin a1c that should n't be actually matter because that checks long term but if we need your blood sugar may be elevated today i i would n't be surprised alright and i forgot to examine your back by the way so on your back exam you do have some tenderness in the paraspinal areas of your back in the in the lower back mostly no midline tenderness you have good reflexes so i think this is all muscular pain right now for your back pain i'm gon na go ahead and put you on some naprosyn and some flexeril which is a muscle relaxer i'm gon na give you some exercises you can do to help you get off the couch it'll also help your blood sugar and why do n't we have you if that does n't work the the pain medicine and

problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise\n[patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but\n[doctor] sure\n[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay\n[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that\n[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff\n[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all\n[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though\n[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while\n[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related\n[doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today\n[patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think\n[doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so\n[patient] these are like my video visit exams\n[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it

Lower back pain.\n- Medical Reasoning: I believe this is more of a muscular sprain.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today.\n- Medical Treatment: I am going to start him on Naprosyn 500 mg twice a day and Flexeril 10 mg twice a day. I will refer him for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in his lower back.\n- Additional Testing: I do not think he needs an x-ray at this stage, however if he does not improve, we will order one for further evaluation.\n\n2. Diabetes.\n- Medical Reasoning: His most recent A1c was 7.1 and his blood sugar levels are typically between 120-140.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today.\n- Medical Treatment: He will continue the metformin 500 mg twice a day.\n- Additional Testing: I am going to order another hemoglobin A1c.\n\n3. Hypertension.\n- Medical Reasoning: He does have 1+ edema in his legs.\n- Patient Education and Counseling: We discussed treatment options today. I explained that his edema is likely caused by the Norvasc.\n- Medical Treatment: The patient will discontinue the use of Norvasc and we will start him on hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg once a day.\n- Additional Testing: I will order a CBC and BMP. Additionally, I will order a repeat EKG, as well as a chest x-ray.\n\nPatient Agreements: The patient understands and agrees with the recommended medical treatment plan.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up in 2 weeks."}], [{"dialogue": "[doctor] good morning ms. reyes !\n[patient] good morning .\n[doctor] how are you doing ma'am ?\n[patient] i'm doing well doctor , how are you ?\n[doctor] i am fine thank you . so you've been having some problems with your right hip ?\n[patient] yeah .\n[doctor] okay , and where are you hurting ?

.\n[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .\n[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?\n[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .\n[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?\n[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .\n[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?\n[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .\n[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?\n[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .\n[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?\n[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .\n[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?\n[patient] mother's .\n[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?\n[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .\n[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?\n[patient] yes , that's correct .\n[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?\n[patient] i own an auto repair shop .\n[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?\n[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .\n[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?\n[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .\n[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?\n[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .\n[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .\n[patient] sure .\n[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?\n[patient] okay , that's fine .\n[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .\n[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .\n[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?\n[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .\n[patient] okay , good .\n[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .\n[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .\n[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .\n[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .\n[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .\n[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .\n[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?\n[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .\n[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .\n[patient] thank you , nice to meet you as well .\n[doctor] please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading .

that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today\n[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding\n[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me\n[patient] yeah that's a mouthful\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here\n[doctor] i'll do this\n[patient] i i think i would break that\n[doctor] yeah i just saw that\n[patient] if you can do that\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up\n[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me\n[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections\n[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual\n[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections\n[doctor] diarrhea no\n[patient] frequently\n[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of\n[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies\n[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy\n[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes\n[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street\n[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes\n[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that\n[doctor] i know i know\n[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away\n[doctor] right\n[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products\n[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally\n[patient] okay where did you go\n[doctor] i was in zambia\n[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful\n[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time\n[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial\n[doctor] no\n[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you\n[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried\n[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea\n[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and\n[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency\n[doctor] why is that\n[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency\n[doctor] okay okay thank

of this this knee pain that i've been having for about six months now\n[doctor] okay and do you remember what caused the pain initially\n[patient] honestly i do n't i ca n't think of anytime if i fell or like i i've really been trying to think and i ca n't really think of any specific event\n[doctor] okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that correct\n[patient] yes both my knees\n[doctor] okay it kinda try let's let's try describing the pain for me please\n[patient] yeah it's kind of feels like it's like right behind my kneecaps\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and it's like a deep achy pain\n[doctor] a deep achy pain okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse\n[patient] let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs\n[doctor] okay so you work from home\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it\n[patient] no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs\n[doctor] okay okay how do you like working from home\n[patient] you know it has it's plus and minuses\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i like it though my i like my commute\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i love it\n[doctor] and the parking i'm sure the parking is\n[patient] and the parking is great\n[doctor] yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better\n[patient] usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all\n[patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it takes the edge off\n[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying\n[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain\n[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office\n[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile\n[doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up\n[patient] exactly\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it's\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n[patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] injured or broken a bone\n[doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me\n[patient] so will i be able to run again\n[doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else\n[patient] no i think that's it\n[doctor] okay have a great day\n[patient] okay you too\n[doctor]

still taking your medications for that you're still on your aspirin\n[patient] i am yes yeah i do the baby aspirin every day\n[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything\n[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams\n[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here\n[patient] no\n[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help\n[patient] any questions\n[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult

Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.\n\nIn terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fevers and chills.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies dyspnea.\nSkin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.\nNeurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.\n\nVITALS\n\nNo fever.\nBlood pressure: 127/80\nHeart rate: 60s\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.\nRESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nNECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits\nMSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot\n2. Diabetes\n3. Coronary artery disease\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.\n\nThe patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer."}], [{"dialogue": "[doctor] hey anna good to see you today so i'm

n't think of anytime if i fell or like i i've really been trying to think and i ca n't really think of any specific event\n[doctor] okay now it it says here that it's in both knees is that

okay\n[patient] and it's like a deep achy pain\n[doctor] a deep achy pain okay what kind of activities makes the pain feel worse\n[patient] let's see so anytime so if i'm sitting at my desk and i get up i have a lot of pain so anytime from like standing up from sitting for a while or even going up and down the stairs\n[doctor] okay so you work from home\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay okay so there is a lot of desk setting at home is your office upstairs or is it i mean do you have to go up or downstairs to get to it\n[patient] no well first thing in the morning but otherwise it's downstairs\n[doctor] okay okay how do you like working from home\n[patient] you know it has it's plus and minuses\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i like it though my i like my commute\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] i love it\n[doctor] and the parking i'm sure the parking is\n[patient] and the parking is great\n[doctor] yeah i you know if i could do telehealth visits all day long i would be totally happy with that yeah and just set it home and do those so you mentioned is there anything that makes that pain feel better\n[patient] usually after like if i feel that pain and then i just it does get better\n[doctor] okay now you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past what have what are they and did they work at all\n[patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] it takes the edge off\n[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying\n[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain\n[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office\n[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile\n[doctor] yeah you know what that's that's i am a biker and i know that once you get that into your you know you have loved doing that activity it's so frustrating when you ca n't it's almost like a it's almost like a dry it almost becomes a drug when you get up\n[patient] exactly\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] it's\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any redness or swelling in your knees\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before\n[patient] you know despite how active i am i you know i've never\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] injured or broken a bone\n[doctor] okay great so let's go ahead and do a i just wan na take a look here i reviewed your vitals and overall they look good your blood pressure is one twenty over seventy your your heart rate is sixty and your respiratory rate is fourteen those are all phenomenal numbers as i listened to your heart it is at a regular and a slower rate but i do n't hear any extra sounds so there is no murmurs as we go through that now on musculoskeletal exam you have a normal gait i watched you you know kinda walk in here this morning your strength i just wan na check it when i go ahead and i want you to move your leg okay your muscle strength is is good you do have a three out of five for abduction of your legs bilaterally and that's you know kinda bringing your legs in the remainder of your muscle strength for your lower extremities is a five out of five now let me focus specifically on your knee examination i do n't see any redness or ecchymosis or warmth of the skin and those are big words you know i do n't see any bruising or or that redness there is no effusion that's just like a fluid underneath the knee i do n't appreciate that any at all you do seem to have some tenderness when i palpate and you do have a positive patellar grind test when you stood up i could feel that as we went through there you did say you had that knee pain with squatting but your lachman your anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray test are all negative bilaterally neurologically and your your your lower extremities your patella and your achilles reflex are symmetrical and that's good so i did review the x-rays of both your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so based on what you told me and reviewing the mri that you had done before you came in your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a really common condition that we see that causes knee knee pain especially in really active young people that's probably why i do n't get it when i'm riding my bike forever and ever now this condition has to do with the way your kneecap moves across along the groove of your thigh bone your femur so for pain i want you to continue to take the ibuprofen or any other anti-inflammatories you know aleve or any of those as you need it to help with the pain now i am going to recommend physical therapy well they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises this is probably one of the best things that you can do and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you might have do you have any questions for me\n[patient] so will i be able to run again\n[doctor] absolutely my goal is to get you out there and maybe we can cross pads on the the bike trail some day you are gon na have to take it a little bit easy for now but we are gon na get you back and once we do that i think you will be really pleased is there anything else\n[patient] no i think

The patient rates her pain level as a 6 out of 10. Ms. Diaz describes her pain as constant and throbbing. She reports that her right ankle is warm to the touch. She denies any numbness or tingling in her right foot. The patient has been icing and elevating her right ankle while also utilizing ibuprofen last night and this morning, which did not provide her with any relief. The patient states that she used to play a lot of soccer in high school so she notes that she has had other right foot injuries but not like this.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Positive right ankle pain.\nSkin: Positive warmth to the right foot.\nNeurological: Denies any numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nBP: 120/80\nSPO2: 98%.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds.

physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive\n[patient] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c\n[doctor] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised\n[patient] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners\n[doctor] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now\n[patient] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay\n[doctor] thank you\n[patient] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot\n[doctor] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to\n[patient] okay and have you ever smoked before\n[doctor] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too\n[patient] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so do you have any other medical conditions\n[doctor] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no

assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound\n[doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them\n[patient] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the

on you more would that be okay with you\n[patient] yes that's okay\n[doctor] okay great thanks so carolyn tell me about your headache and headache or headaches when did when did they start and and what symptoms are you having\n[patient] my headache started about a week ago it's feeling like a dull pain in the back of my head i have flushing in my ears they get really red and hot and sometimes i just feel a little bit dizzy when i get these headaches but i've taken tylenol and advil and it's not really going away it just keeps coming back\n[doctor] okay and alright and so this started about a week ago has it been fairly constant since it started or does it come and go does it come and go or what\n[patient] it comes and goes i it it's relieved when i take my tylenol or advil but then it comes right back\n[doctor] hmmm okay and do you notice any any timing difference you know is it is it worse in the morning worse in the evening is there anything else that makes it better or worse\n[patient] it's definitely worse in the evening\n[doctor] okay and do you feel any sort of tightness in the back of your neck or in your shoulders or you know you said it's in the back of your head primarily any discomfort anywhere else\n[patient] yes no just in the back of my head\n[doctor] okay and did the headache start all of a sudden carolyn or has it been gradual or what\n[patient] i've been under a lot of stress lately so maybe about when some stress started occurring\n[doctor] okay okay and alright and have you noticed any fever along with the headache\n[patient] no no fever\n[doctor] okay and any visual changes you know wavy lines in your vision spots in your vision or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you had headaches like this before\n[patient] i have\n[doctor] okay so this is n't the worst headache you've ever had what did you say\n[patient] no it's not\n[doctor] okay alright and so okay fair enough now how's your diabetes been been been doing lately have you what have your blood sugars been running in the low one hundreds or two hundreds or what\n[patient] i have n't been checking my blood sugars\n[doctor] really okay well we will get you back on that and and we can talk about that but how about your metformin are you still taking the five hundred milligrams once a day no actually it looks like we increased your metformin to five hundred milligrams twice a day last visit are you still taking that\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay great and okay you're still watching your diet and getting some exercise\n[patient] i have not been eating well because i've been stressed over the last week but i have n't been exercising for maybe the past week but generally i've been doing better\n[doctor] okay the headache has has maybe made you feel uncomfortable and prevented your your exercise would you say or what\n[patient] yes it has\n[doctor] okay okay so you probably have n't been out golfing i remember you're a big golfer so not not lately uh so you know being\n[patient] not lately\n[doctor] being down being down here in florida we got ta get get some golf in so hey did you see the masters by the way a few weeks ago was n't that i do n't know did you happen to catch it\n[patient] i did\n[doctor] yeah that was crazy what a what a finish what an amazing what an amazing tournament right what do you think yeah yeah that's great well we'll we'll get you feeling better and get you back out there and now are you still working a lot on the computer ac or\n[patient] i am\n[doctor] carolyn okay yeah you're still working a lot on the computer for work okay are you taking breaks every hour or so you know get up stand around walk stand walk around that can be helpful\n[patient] no i really do n't get the opportunity to\n[doctor] hmmm okay understood alright well listen let's go ahead and examine you okay so so on your physical exam your physical exam is pretty normal unremarkable for the most part and you know few things a few exceptions so first of all on your heent exam your eye exam your extraocular motions are intact without pain you have a funduscopic exam that shows no papilledema that's good that just means there's no swelling in the back of your eye and on your neck exam you do have some posterior mild posterior paraspinal muscular tenderness in the cervical spine and in bilateral trapezius musculature as well and some tightness in those muscles as well and otherwise on your exam let's see your heart exam on your heart exam you have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam so it just means i hear some sounds in your heart as it's beating and i'm not too worried about that we'll watch that and otherwise normal heart exam and and your physical examination otherwise is normal and unremarkable and so now let's talk about my assessment and your plan so carolyn for your first problem of the headache i do think that you have a tension type headache and i think this because you've got some tension and tightness in your paraspinal muscles meaning the muscles around your neck and your shoulders and you know working at the computer i think is contributing to this and also probably the stress so you can continue to take that tylenol for the pain i'm also gon na give you a mild muscle relaxant i'll write you for flexeril five milligrams three times a day and you can take that that will help relax those muscles in your neck and that should help with the symptoms i want you to come back or give us a call if the headaches become more severe or suddenly worsen or you develop a fever but i do n't think that this is a a sign of a stroke or any bleeding in your brain or anything like that i think it's more related to tightness in your muscles in your neck now for your second problem of your diabetes mellitus let's continue you on the metformin five hundred milligrams i am going to order a hemoglobin a1c and also a cbc and a chem-12 to check some of your blood tests blood chemistries and so forth and we will continue you on the metformin i do want you to check your blood sugars daily and that will be very helpful so when you come back in a month i want you to bring those numbers with you we can talk about it again and please do try to get back into your exercise routine that's really gon na help you keep those blood sugars under control as well okay so how does that sound for a plan any other questions for me\n[patient] well would it so only call if if it gets worse or not any better\n[doctor] yeah that that just right but also let's set up an appointment in four weeks and i wan na see you back in four weeks if it's not if the headache is not better within the next few days with this flexeril then you can give us a call and and get back in later this week or early next but definitely if things get worse give us a call sooner and you know i meant to ask you on i wanted to ask if you had a history of any any trauma meaning have you hit your head or you have n't fallen hit your head or anything like that have you\n[patient] no no i think it's just stress\n[doctor] okay alright understood okay great well then i'll see you back in a month if not before okay you take care of yourself nice seeing you\n[patient] thank you\n[doctor] sure", "summary": "CHIEF

nothing at all\n[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that\n[doctor] no\n[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before\n[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help\n[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck\n[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain\n[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder\n[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere\n[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go\n[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well\n[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it\n[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works

a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] acromioclavicular joints\n[doctor] yeah yeah\n[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch\n[doctor] yes thank you yep\n[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are\n[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder\n[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before\n[doctor] i have n't\n[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan\n[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days\n[doctor] okay

humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] acromioclavicular joints\n[doctor] yeah yeah\n[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch\n[doctor] yes thank you yep\n[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are\n[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder\n[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before\n[doctor] i have n't\n[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan\n[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away\n[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days\n[doctor] okay alright thank you\n[patient] bye\n[doctor] okay bye", "summary": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft shoulder pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nAlan Mitchell is a pleasant 69-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of left shoulder pain. The onset of his pain began 3 weeks ago, without any improvement. He denies any specific injury; however, he has been renovating his basement and putting in a new ceiling. He does not recall hitting or falling onto the left shoulder. The patient states he is very active and has experienced left shoulder pain before that usually resolves with Tylenol.\n\nThe patient reports significant pain with reaching, lifting, and overhead activities. The pain is constant. He states the pain is primarily located in the left shoulder and denies it radiates down into the left arm. The patient also reports difficulty sleeping secondary to the pain. He denies any numbness or tingling in his left arm or fingers. He has been taking Tylenol for pain, which provides partial relief. He initially iced his shoulder but has not iced it recently. The patient denies he has done any physical therapy.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nMusculoskeletal: Reports left shoulder pain. Neurological: Denies numbness or tingling.\n\nVITALS\n\nAll vital signs are within the normal limits.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nMSK: Examination of the left shoulder: Limited active and passive ROM. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus. No tenderness at the sternoclavicular or AC joints. Good hand grip. Neurovascularly intact distally. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds. Sensation is intact to light touch distally.\n\nRESULTS\n\nX-rays of the left shoulder were obtained and reviewed today. These are normal and reveal no fracture or bony abnormalities.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nLeft shoulder pain, likely rotator cuff tendinopathy.\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination and radiographic findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with him regarding his current symptoms. I have explained that his x-rays did not reveal any signs of a fracture. I have recommended that we obtain an MRI of the left shoulder to evaluate for possible rotator cuff tendinopathy. The patient was provided with a referral to formal physical therapy. He will engage in a 6-to-8-week course in order to strengthen his left shoulder. I have also advised him to take Tylenol as needed for pain. If his symptoms do not improve, we may consider a steroid injection to the left shoulder.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nThe patient will follow up with me once the MRI results are available for review and further discussion."}], [{"dialogue": "[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing\n[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain\n[doctor] so it looks like here that you came in to see us today for an evaluation of that right elbow pain can you tell me can you can you tell me well first of all what do you think has been causing that pain\n[patient] so i really during this pandemic i really got into ceramics and doing pottery so i've been doing a lot of pottery and over the past week i then started to develop this elbow pain\n[doctor] okay and then so tell me a little bit more about that elbow pain where does it hurt exactly\n[patient] you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow\n[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that\n[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm\n[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything\n[patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything\n[doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before\n[patient] no\n[doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life\n[patient] i would say probably a six\n[doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night\n[patient] it does\n[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities\n[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain\n[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on\n[patient] about four days now\n[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief\n[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much\n[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here\n[patient] yes i do\n[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that\n[patient] not really\n[doctor] okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that\n[patient] yeah that hurts\n[doctor] okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist\n[patient] yes i do\n[doctor] alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend\n[doctor] that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on doing any type of pottery work okay alright now what i wan na do is i wan na see you again in a week and i wan na see how you're doing okay\n[patient] alrighty\n[doctor] alrighty so i'll have the nurse come in and get you set up with that sling and i will see you again in about a week\n[patient] alright thank you\n[doctor] thank you", "summary": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight elbow pain.\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS\n\nLawrence Butler is a pleasant 45-year-old male who presents to the clinic today for the evaluation of right elbow pain.\n\nOver the past week, the patient has developed 6/10 pain in the \"inside\" of his right elbow.

linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on\n[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] started having pain on my left back\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain\n[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go\n[patient] it's constant\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable\n[doctor] alright are you able to urinate\n[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood\n[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes\n[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time\n[doctor] third time alright\n[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time\n[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever\n[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous\n[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain\n[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working\n[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved\n[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah\n[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] so we are getting close there\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff\n[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff\n[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running\n[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the\n[doctor] the one eighties which was really high\n[patient] right\n[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that\n[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] like\n[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help\n[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright\n[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday\n[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds\n[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday\n[patient] i do\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i do take it\n[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain\n[patient] no chest pain\n[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain\n[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain\n[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful\n[patient] yes\n[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound\n[patient] that sounds good and i i just i just want this pain to go away so thank you\n[doctor] okay no problem", "summary": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nLeft-sided back

morning\n[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it\n[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today\n[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo\n[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it\n[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were\n[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now\n[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler\n[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night\n[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports\n[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens\n[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too\n[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem\n[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening\n[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] for the symptoms\n[doctor] yes\n[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so\n[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack\n[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening\n[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout\n[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems\n[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense\n[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having\n[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do\n[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation\n[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too\n[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and everything sounds good\n[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes\n[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that\n[doctor] yeah i think so yeah\n[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal\n[doctor] awesome\n[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it\n[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that\n[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you\n[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year\n[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that\n[doctor] yeah\n[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start\n[doctor] mm-hmm\n[patient] and we will do some

sure\n[patient] but that day i i lost the i lost the argument\n[doctor] yeah yeah that happens to all of this so when this back pain happened so it was basically you were lifting you were bending down to lift something up and you had the sharp pain going down your right leg you said\n[patient] left leg\n[doctor] left leg okay got it sorry and any weakness or numbness in your legs or just the pain mostly\n[patient] in in certain positions i get some tingling but no mostly just pain\n[doctor] okay and any loss of bowel or bladder function at all or anything like that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and have you had any back surgeries or back problems in the past or this is kind of the first time\n[patient] no surgeries you know i've i've had back pain occasionally over the years\n[doctor] okay have you had any any have you tried anything for pain for this have you tried any any medications at all\n[patient] i've had ibuprofen it it helped some\n[doctor] okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise\n[patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but\n[doctor] sure\n[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay\n[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that\n[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff\n[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all\n[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though\n[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while\n[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related\n[doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay\n[patient] okay\n[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today\n[patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think\n[doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so\n[patient] these are like my video visit exams\n[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything\n[patient] no i i think i'm okay you gave me a year's worth of refills last time we were together\n[doctor] okay sounds great alright thanks gabriel good seeing you again\n[patient] good to see you thanks",

little bit high it was one fifty over seventy so have you been taking your medications regularly\n[patient] yes i have\n[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my

during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that\n[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made

that you currently do have i'm also gon na put you in a a knee brace just to try and support those muscles to allow it to heal and then i want you to ice the knee you can do that for twenty minutes at

okay and did you see anybody for this before coming into the office here\n[patient] yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you\n[doctor] okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct\n[patient] yeah that's right\n[doctor] okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases\n[patient] i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no\n[doctor] okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on\n[patient] it actually is worse towards the end of the day\n[doctor] okay\n[patient] once i'm on my feet

heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right\n[patient] that feels that feels normal\n[doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit\n[patient] no\n[doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here\n[patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside\n[doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan\n[patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym\n[doctor] yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do\n[patient] okay got it\n[doctor] any questions\n[patient] hmmm no i do

have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help\n[patient] any questions\n[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more

male who presents today for evaluation of a right foot ulcer. He reports an ulcer on his right foot has been present for approximately 6 to 8 weeks. He first noticed the ulcer after working outside. There is no associated pain, however, he feels the ulcer may have worsened from when he first noticed it. He denies experiencing any fevers or chills. He does however experience tension headaches quite frequently. He denies any pain in his calves when he walks. At this time the patient does not have a podiatrist for yearly foot exams.\n\nHe is a diabetic and takes insulin. His blood sugar has been running higher than normal and his last hemoglobin A1c was higher than 9. Occasionally he will also experience numbness and tingling in his feet, especially with colder weather.\n\nIn terms of his heart disease, the patient sustained a heart attack in 2018 and underwent stent placement at the right coronary artery. He is currently taking aspirin 81 mg daily. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports history of diabetes and heart disease. He sustained a heart attack in 2018.\n\nSURGICAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports undergoing stent placement at the right coronary artery.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY\n\nPatient reports he is a former smoker. He previously smoked 2 packs a day for 20 years and was able to stop smoking approximately 4 years ago. Currently he is not very active but he does work around the house.\n\nMEDICATIONS\n\nPatient reports taking aspirin 81 mg daily and insulin.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS\n\nConstitutional: Denies fevers and chills.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain.\nRespiratory: Denies dyspnea.\nSkin: Patient reports right foot ulcer.\nNeurological: Patient reports headaches and numbness and tingling in feet.\n\nVITALS\n\nNo fever.\nBlood pressure: 127/80\nHeart rate: 60s\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM\n\nCV: 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base.\nRESPIRATORY: Clear to auscultation bilaterally\nNECK: No jugular venous distention or carotid bruits\nMSK: Examination of the right lower extremity: No palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses. There is a 2 x 3 cm ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the 5th metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint. No associated cellulitis. No pain to palpation of the right foot. There is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound.\n\nASSESSMENT\n\n1. Non-healing ulcer, right foot\n2. Diabetes\n3. Coronary artery disease\n\nPLAN\n\nAfter reviewing the patient's examination findings today, I have had a lengthy discussion with the patient in regards to his current symptoms. We discussed that his right foot ulcer is fairly sizable and will require wound care. I advised him that the ulcer does not appear to be healing and that further studies will be needed to assess if he has adequate blood supply to heal his foot wound. He was advised that due to his diabetes it is possible surgical intervention such as stent placement or bypass surgery may be required to improve his blood supply. I also advised him that I believe we will be able to heal his wound. At this time, I have recommended continued wound care and for him to also continue taking aspirin 81 mg daily. We will order an arterial ultrasound of the lower extremities. He will also be referred to podiatry for a consult.\n\nRegarding his diabetes, this appears to be unstable as the patient reports his last hemoglobin a1c was greater than 9 and is now experiencing a non-healing right foot ulcer. We discussed the importance of blood sugar control as this will impact his wound healing. At this time, I have recommended that he follow-up with his primary care physician for further care.\n\nThe patient's coronary artery disease is currently stable. It is recommended that he continue to take his statin as prescribed. I will contact his cardiologist for medical clearance should surgical intervention be required for his non-healing right foot ulcer."}], [{"dialogue": "[doctor] so sophia i see that you you hurt your knee tell me about what happened\n[patient] yeah i was jumping on my kid's trampoline and i could just slipped out from under me\n[doctor] my gosh one of those big trampolines in your back yard\n[patient] yeah a pretty big one\n[doctor] okay which knee was it\n[patient] my right knee\n[doctor] right knee okay and when did this happen\n[patient] about four days ago\n[doctor] great the weather was perfect this weekend so i'm glad you at least got outside sorry to hear you got hurt okay so your right knee did you did you feel it like pop or or snap or anything when you hurt it\n[patient] yeah i felt a little pop and then it swelled up really big afterward\n[doctor] okay did you try anything for the pain\n[patient] i took some ibuprofen and i put some ice on it\n[doctor] okay did that help\n[patient] a little bit but it's still really hard to get around\n[doctor] alright and have you have you been able to stand on it or does that hurt too much\n[patient] it hurts quite a bit to stand but i am able to put weight on it\n[doctor] okay alright and what part of the knee is it inside outside middle\n[patient] kind of that inside part of my kneecap\n[doctor] okay alright and okay so as long as you're here and then your primary care physician i'm looking through your chart and it looks like we're treating your diabetes so how you've been doing with your your diet overall are you are you keeping your sugars low\n[patient] it's going okay i i forget to check quite a bit though\n[doctor] sure\n[patient] on it\n[doctor] yeah i understand how has your diet been lately\n[patient] it's been pretty good\n[doctor] okay okay good good you know it's hard to stay away from the sugary foods sometimes i i enjoy ice cream regularly okay so let's do physical exam as long as you are here so i'm just gon na listen to your heart your heart sounds normal no murmurs or gallops listen to your lungs quick if you can take a deep breath lungs are clear that's good news let's take a look at that knee right knee looks like it definitely has some swelling i'm gon na do some maneuvers here does it hurt when i push you on the inside of the knee\n[patient] yeah that hurts\n[doctor] okay how about the outside\n[patient] a little bit but not as much\n[doctor] okay so some pain on palpation on the inside little bit of pain on the outside of the knee if i bend the knee back does that hurt\n[patient] yeah\n[doctor] how about when i extend it\n[patient] yeah that hurts\n[doctor] okay so little bit of limited range of motion as well as pain on both flexion and extension on the knee i'm gon na push on this a little bit looks like your mcmurray's test is negative just checking for a meniscus tear okay so let's talk a little bit about your plan what i am concerned about for your knee is it sounds like you have a torn or injured mcl i it's that inside tendon in your knee so i'm concerned about that since you're having trouble with weightbearing and you heard that pop so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na put you in a straight leg brace and i'll prescribe some mobic you can start taking that as a a pain reliever and to try to get some of the swelling down i want you to ice your knee once an hour for about fifteen minutes but i'm also gon na send you out for an mri because we wan na make sure this is what happens see if there's any other damage to the knee does that sound good\n[patient] yeah that sounds great thank you\n[doctor] yeah and then for your diabetes as long as you're here it sounds like you're managing that pretty well but i do wan na get a recheck on your hemoglobin a1c and then i'm also i'm going to get a refill on the metformin that you have been taking five hundred milligrams so you can keep taking that as well so do you have any other questions for me\n[patient] no that's it thanks\n[doctor] alright well thank you hope that you feel better", "summary": "CHIEF COMPLAINT\n\nRight knee pain.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY\n\nThe patient has a history of diabetes.

heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee

there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here\n[patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside\n[doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that\n[patient] no uh uh\n[doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan\n[patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym\n[doctor] yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to
