# SummQA
MediQA Task A and B

## Notes for running the submission:

When running activation.sh, the environment is automatically deactivated after the shell script exits, so to get around this, we have activated the environment in decode_{taskA|B|C}_run{1|2|3}.sh before running the Python script. So our submission can be effectively run as ./initial.sh and then the corresponding decode shell script.
