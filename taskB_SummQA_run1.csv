D2N098,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Jose James, born on 9/29/1957, is a new patient presenting with constant pain in his left shoulder and elbow for the past five months. The pain began after a fall on icy stairs, where he landed on his left side. The pain has been persistent and worsened when lifting weights. Mr. James has stopped exercising due to the pain but continues to walk daily with his wife.

PHYSICAL EXAM:

D2N114,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient has been struggling with headaches for years, initially occurring around menstrual periods and during stress. Recently, the headaches have become more frequent and severe, mostly on the right side and behind the eye, with a pulsing sensation. The patient also experiences ringing in the ears and occasional blurred vision. Headaches worsen during exercise.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
Vitals, including blood pressure, are normal. Heart exam shows normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Funduscopic exam shows papilledema. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves one through twelve are intact, including normal cranial reflexes. Musculoskeletal exam shows normal gait.

RESULTS:
Pending MRI and further tests.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
The patient's symptoms are concerning for idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The plan includes obtaining an MRI to check for any other contributing conditions, performing a spinal tap to evaluate and potentially alleviate pressure in the brain, and scheduling a complete eye exam with a neuro-ophthalmologist. If idiopathic intracranial hypertension is confirmed, medications may be prescribed to decrease pressure in the brain, and the patient will be encouraged to exercise and lose weight as part of the treatment."
D2N115,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Jack, was involved in a car accident a week ago, where his neck and head moved forward quickly. He has been experiencing neck pain since then, rating it as a 7 out of 10 in severity.

D2N122,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, Kyle, has had a cough for about three months, which was initially diagnosed as bronchitis. A chest X-ray was performed to rule out pneumonia, and a lung nodule was discovered. A subsequent CT scan confirmed the presence of the nodule. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, which is currently under control with methotrexate. The patient is a former smoker, having quit approximately seven years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAM:
